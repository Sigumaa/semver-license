# SemVer LICENSE

[![License: SemVer](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-SemVer%20LICENSE-blue)](./LICENSE)

**SemVer LICENSE** is a simple and strict open-source license that **enforces Semantic Versioning (SemVer) compliance** for all modifications, forks, and redistributions.

## Why Use SemVer LICENSE?

Software projects often fail to follow proper **Semantic Versioning** conventions, causing **breaking changes in minor updates** and **unexpected behavior for users**.  
This license ensures that:
- **Breaking changes must increase the major version.**
- **New features must increase the minor version.**
- **Bug fixes must increase the patch version.**
- **Violating these rules may result in license revocation.**

## How to Apply

Simply add this to your repository's `LICENSE` file:

```
Licensed under the SemVer LICENSE, Version 1.0.  
See https://github.com/Sigumaa/semver-license for details.  
```

You can also display this badge in your `README.md`:

```
[![License: SemVer](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-SemVer%20LICENSE-blue)](./LICENSE)
```
